# R4DS Online Learning Community Website

This repository contains (or, at this moment, *will* contain) the main online presense for the R4DS Online Learning Community.
This repository represents a complete overhaul of the R4DS Online Learning Community's online presence.

The goal of this refresh is to make the site do these jobs:

- Help people trust R4DS.
- Make it easy for new learners to find help.
- Allow learners to keep learning.
- Recruit mentors.
